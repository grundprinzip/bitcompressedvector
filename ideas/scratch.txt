Horizontal vs Vertical Bit Packing for In-Memory Column Stores


* Show implementation of vertical and horizontal bit packing
* compare advantages of each implementation

* benchmark bit cases


* Random Access
* Full Sequntial Scan
* Scan with different increasing selectivity



* Propose mechanism to automatically choose the right bit packing algorithm
	* probably workload dependent
	* can we deduce an optimum that is independent of the workload and only dependent on the bit case
